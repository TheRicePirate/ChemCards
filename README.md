To create a new card set, select 'Create new set' and give your set a name from the window that pops up.
The sets are all stored as JSON files.

From the create set menu, you can generate chemical diagrams by pasting in their SMILES IDs. You can find the SMILES ID
of any chemical by searching for them online (PubChem and Wikipedia are good sources).

Once you have the chemical diagram generated, you can enter in a question and answer to be associated with the diagram.

Once you are finished creating cards, hit "Finish". This will write all of your cards to the JSON file you created earlier.

You can load and play through your cards in a randomized order by loading them in the main screen.
